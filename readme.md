# Portfolio

Welcome to my digital playground! Here, you'll find a collection of my proudest moments, my learning adventures, and a dash of whimsy. 🎨👩‍💻

Sometimes it felt like climbing mountains, and other times like tripping over our own shoelaces (oops, did I really just do that on production). But hey, it's all part of the journey! 

In this website you can find, projects that I am proud of; projects that I am not so proud of and what did I learn from them.
